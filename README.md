#Objective:

Objective of this assignment is to understand 3D viewing pipeline and
basics of object modeling.

Task I: Create a Childrenâ€™s park with the help of openGL primitives. Use openGL
transformations to put the props used at the right place. Everything should be solid
colored and you are not allowed to use textures. Try to be creative.

Task II: Download Blender and create a prop using Blender. Save it as obj format and
import it in openGL and then place it correctly in your scene.

Part II: Write functions to interact with your scene. For example write functions to pan,
zoom, roll the camera.
